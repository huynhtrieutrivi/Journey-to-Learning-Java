# Journey-to-Learning-Java
Containing programs created using learned knowledge to reinforce it. 

Starting Date: June 01, 2020

Hi, my name is Vi and this is my journey to learning Java. I have started learning Java in school but I was struggling to learn effective in school due to the pacing and the teaching style since I wasn't able to retain as much of the knowledge in school. So I started to learn Java in my free time, especially right now since it is summer time. I have started to take a course on Udemy called "Java Master Class" by Tim Buchalka and hopefully I will be able to understand the basic fundamentals of programming and java and more after taking this course.


NOTE: If any of the projects name/code seem weird or out of context, the prompt for these codes were originally from my Udemy course so these code made from there. I'm unable to copy and paste the prompt so it might be unclear on what the code is actually doing (sorry!).

NOTE: For the first part of my learning process I was using the web-based java compiler that my teacher provided for students to code in. Later on in my programming process, I decided to learn to use an actual IDE (Intellij) & learned to install a JDK, config it, etcs.

Containing programs created using learned knowledge to reinforce it.

Hi, my name is Vi and this is my journey to learning Java. I have started learning Java in school but I was struggling to learn effective in school due to the pacing and the teaching style since I wasn't able to retain as much of the knowledge in school. So I started to learn Java in my free time, especially right now since it is summer time. I have started to take a course on Udemy called "Java Master Class" by Tim Buchalka and hopefully I will be able to understand the basic fundamentals of programming and java and more after taking this course.
